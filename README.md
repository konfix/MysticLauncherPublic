Welcome to **Mystic Launcher**, your ultimate custom Minecraft Launcher! 🚀<br>
Built to seamlessly connect you (<i>the launcher</i>) and Mystic Network!

This repository only contains pre-built versions of the launcher, in releases.

## ⭐ Why Mystic Launcher?
The answer is quite simple &ndash; while other launchers may provide the core functionality of joining
and playing the game, Mystic Launcher was custom built by Mystic Network's development team to better
integrate your game with our server.

What does this all mean for regular users? This means that just by using our launcher, you will get
dozens of new mods that offer new, useful functions you don't have on vanilla, while also optimizing
your game's performances and overall stability when playing on Mystic Network.

You will also save lots of time &ndash; launcher users can forget about annoying authentification on
join, simply hit the PLAY button and you will be ready to play in under a minute!
